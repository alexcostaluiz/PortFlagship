        <span class="content-paragraph">
          Funding from The Language Flagship allows The University of Georgia Portuguese Flagship
          Program to offer merit-based funding for students with a proven track record of dedication
          to and success in the study of Portuguese. PFP scholars in good standing may receive funding for
          summer immersion programs in the U.S. and Brazil and funding for the Capstone Year program.
          Students are expected to seek out other funding sources and scholarships, from UGA and outside
          UGA, to complement Flagship support.<br>
          <br>
          The Flagship Program also provides Pre-Collegiate Scholarships of $500 to graduating high school
          seniors participating in approved Summer immersion programs. These students must also be admitted
          to UGA and have also applied, and been accepted into, the Portuguese Flagship Program. See info
          about the <a class="content-link" href="k12.php">Federal Service Language Academyâ€™s Summer Program</a>.
