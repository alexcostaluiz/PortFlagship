      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        To be eligible, you must be a full time UGA student in good standing. Incoming freshmen will
        also be considered for the program.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">I am not a UGA student, can I still apply?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        You must be accepted for admission to UGA to be eligible for our program. If you are a transfer
        student, you must first gain UGA acceptance. You will be able to apply once you have started your
        studies here.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">I am graduating within a year, am I still eligible?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        We expect a commitment of between 3 and 5 years. You must be able to reach Advanced proficiency in
        Portuguese to pursue the mandatory Capstone Year in Brazil, and Superior to receive Flagship certification,
        a process which normally takes 4 years. For this reason, a senior in first year Portuguese would not be a
        good match for our program.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">I am a graduate student, am I eligible?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        No, the PFP is aimed at undergraduate students. As a graduate student you should look for funding such as
        the FLAS, Teaching Assistantships, and UGA Graduate Fellowships.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">How good does my Portuguese have to be?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        You may be at any level of Portuguese, including a complete beginner if you are an incoming freshman.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">I am a native speaker of Portuguese, am I eligible to apply?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        It depends on your level of proficiency in Portuguese. If you speak and read Portuguese fluently and
        are already at or above the Superior level, this is not the best match for you. However, if your level
        is in the Intermediate to Advanced range of proficiency, you are welcome to apply.
      </p>
      <p class="content-header center-text font20 pad16 nobottom">Do I have to be a Romance Languages major?</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph pad16 bottom32 padNoTop">
        No, the PFP accepts students from any major and is particularly interested in applicants that come from
        other disciplines such as business, engineering, journalism, natural sciences, and social sciences.
