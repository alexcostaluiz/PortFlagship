          The Portuguese Flagship Program (PFP) at the University of Georgia is the first and only of its kind.
          Intended for UGA undergraduate students with a unique commitment to reach the highest levels of Portuguese
          and apply those skills in a professional context, the PFP offers an unprecedented opportunity for motivated
          students to internationalize their academic experience. For many it will also serve as a stepping-stone into
          an international career. More than a study abroad program, the PFP is structured to complement the student’s
          major area of study from the moment he or she arrives at UGA. Participating students also benefit from accelerated
          classes, regular group or one-on-one tutorials, Skype partners in Brazil, rich cultural events, support for
          immersion experiences both in the US and abroad, and a capstone year studying at UFSJ - a leading Brazilian
          university - and completing a semester long internship in Brazil. Throughout their four years of study, PFP
          students strive to achieve superior proficiency in Portuguese and gain insight into how this skill and body
          of knowledge will create future opportunities. We encourage you to browse the site and contact us, or just
          visit us at the PFP office.

        <span class="content-paragraph clearboth">
          Portuguese is currently the 7th most widely spoken language in the world. Also, the rapid growth of the Brazilian economy
          (now the 6th largest worldwide) is causing a surge in the demand for Portuguese speakers. Home of the 2014 World Cup and the
          2016 Olympics (in Rio de Janeiro), Brazil is on the rise, as is the Portuguese language. From Europe to Africa, Asia to North
          America – with large Lusophone communities in the US and Canada – knowledge of Portuguese has never been more important. Graduates
          from Flagship centers are highly sought after in both the public and private sector, and gain a competitive edge when applying
          for jobs, graduate school, and scholarships. The Portuguese Flagship Program is accepting applications now from UGA undergradate
          students.
