          High school students from Georgia and from all over the country can participate in a
          Portuguese summer immersion program at the University of North Georgiaâ€™s Federal Service
          Language Academy (FLSA) in Dahlonega, GA. This three week intensive program in the North Georgia
          mountains provides motivated high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors with the fundamentals
          of Portuguese, exposure to Brazilian cultural norms, a springboard into college-level
          foreign language study, and a possible career in the federal government. Guest speakers
          from the US State Department, FBI, Defense Department, and Homeland Security meet the students
          and present information about careers in public service, particularly in an international
          context. Beginning Portuguese will be offered during Session I (June 5-24, 2016) and continued
          in the intermediate level during Session 2 (June 5-24, 2016).This program is an ideal step
          for students who are admitted to UGA (or who anticipate applying to UGA) and wish to participate
          in the Portuguese Flagship Program. The Flagship Program anticipates providing Pre-Collegiate
          Scholarships of $500 to graduating seniors who have been admitted to UGA and who have applied
          formally to, and been accepted provisionally into, the Portuguese Flagship Program. Click here
